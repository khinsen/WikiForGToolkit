!Wikis for GToolkit
Wikis are multi-page documents in which each page has a name and can be linked to via this name. This documentation is an example of a wiki. More precisely, it is a ${wikiPage:name=ClassWiki}$, i.e. a wiki that is part of a class and thus stored along with Pharo code, in the image and usually also in a Git repository.

There are currently no other types of wiki in this package, but there is an infrastructure to implement wikis with different storage modes but sharing the same user interface. See ${wikiPage:name=ImplementingWikis}$ to learn more about this.

If you are curious about the implementation of the wiki infrastructure, read ${wikiPage:name=InsideWikis}$.

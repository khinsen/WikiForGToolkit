!Wikis for GToolkit
Wikis are multi-page documents in which each page has a name and can be linked to via this name. This documentation is an example of a wiki. More precisely, it is a ${wikiPage:name=ClassWiki}$, i.e. a wiki that is attached to a class such that its pages are stored along with Pharo code, in the image and usually also in a Git repository.

There are currently no other types of wiki in this package, but there is an infrastructure to implement wikis that have different storage modes but share the same user interface. See ${wikiPage:name=ImplementingWikis}$ to learn more about this.
If you want to add a wiki to a ${class:name=GtHomeSection}$,  use ${method:name=GtHomeSection>>#newWikiCardFor:}$.

If you are curious about the implementation of the wiki infrastructure, read ${wikiPage:name=InsideWikis}$.
